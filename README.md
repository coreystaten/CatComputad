# CatComputad

This is a library for, among other things, applying higher-dimensional rewriting rules to "monoidal 3-computads".  This repository also includes code for applying the library to the theory of symmetric monoidal 3-categories.   Documentation for the library is in Chapter 3 of my thesis, which can be found inside of the dissertation folder.
